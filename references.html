                               <p>At Moog, I've met some fantastic people who were eager to share their experiences and
                                expertise with me. It was from their mentoring that I was able to not only take what I've learned in the class
                                classroom and apply it to a real-world setting, but I was also able to pick up new skills technically and
                                professional. If you were to inquire them about my qualities, I strongly believe they would say that I am diligent,
                                a quick learner, and able to communicate effectively and professionally. Some major projects that I worked on included
                                the Incident Logging Application and the Moog Training Sign-up Application. Technologies used included Sharepoint 2013,
                                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery.</p>

                               <p>Carestream was no different than Moog in the sense that there were great people that I've had the fortunate to meet.
                               Through hard work and an eagerness to learn new things, I've gained valuable experience and connections here. I was able
                               to use my existing skills to redesign an existing website for the Telecommunications department at Carestream. My redesign 
                               facilitated site navigation and was user-friendly. I believe that my references from Carestream would agree that I'm bright,
                               diligent, resourceful, and able to take on multiple assignments if needed.</p>
