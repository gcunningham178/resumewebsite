                                         Technology. I'm a very well-rounded person who views life from various perspectives. I have an extremely strategic approach to making decisions, which means that I calculate
                                         every step and look at all possible outcomes. Having a sense of humor is very important to me, as it is a wonderful
                                         coping mechanism to stress. When in doubt, smile big and stand tall to make yourself feel better.</p>

                                         <p class="start-para">I was born in the city of Buffalo, New York. In my opinion, it's a pretty small city,
                                          but plenty to do and easy to get around in. During my adoloscent years, I attended an arts school and remained there
                                          until I graduated. So you can imagine that attending a university specializing in technology was a complete
                                          game-changer for me. I've always had an interest in technology, but no means or guidance to pursue it until I attended
                                          RIT.

                                            This has led me to hone my skills in front-end web development. Making things easy for the user is my aim
                                            when I'm designing and developing an application. If the user can fulfill his/her tasks with the application in the most
                                            effective manner plausible, then I know that I have done my job. Facilitating user interaction with an application is a very important
                                            component to improving the user experience. In short, I specialize in front-end development, but I can develop software
                                            applications for the desktop.</p>

                                               constant improvement and doing one's best. I do research to keep myself updated on the latest and most popular
                                               technologies out there. There are so many frameworks and programming languages that one has to be able to keep up
                                               with the changes or get left behind. Having a strong foundation in core languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can
                                                benefit you when learning new frameworks and technologies. Hence, I have this foundation and can pick up underlying concepts
                                                of new frameworks.</p>

                                             was actually Civil Engineering Technology, so the switch was a huge change for me. What brought about this drastic change
                                             was when I explored different web sites on my first laptop and wondered how they were created. Therefore, I talked to my academic advisor, and now
                                             here I am!</p>

                                              ideas life. I also like to challenge myself by solving problems, making computing an even more appealing choice for me. It is 
                                              in this field that I can test my problem-solving and creative thinking skills. What's nice about Information Technology is that it is
                                              such a broad field that you can take any route in it. It's like a giant tree with many branches going in different directions, but they all stem from the 
                                              same roots.</p>

                                            and efficiently. Finding that balance when it comes to time management plays an integral role in the completion of an
                                            assignment. I don't want to rush a job, but I also don't want to take too much time and miss the deadline. Thus, being punctual and
                                            efficient are two key qualities that I have as a potential employee.</p>
